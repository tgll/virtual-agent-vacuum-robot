### MIASHS

Virtual Agent Vacuum Robot 
--------------------------

The purpose of our work is to study the decision-making of various actors in the vacuum cleaner industry (vacuum cleaners, businesses, and consumers).

The artificial agent can be simulated in different ways:

* Basic actions rule
* Random
* Supervised Reinforcement Learning
* Genetics Algorithms

Each vacuum cleaner is defined by his way of making his decisions. All the vacuum cleaners have the same sensors: they perceive the box on which they are, the box on their right and the one on their left. In addition the vacuum cleaners can perform the same actions: move to the right, move to the left, suck dust or rest.
